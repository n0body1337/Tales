## 🔥 What is Tales?

**Tales** is a modern UCI chess engine written from the ground up in **Rust**. It is a complete re-engineering of the [OpenTal](https://github.com/) engine (itself derived from the **Rodent III** chess engine by Pawel Koziol), rebuilt for speed, safety, and aggressive play.

Tales is not a translation — it is a **ground-up Rust implementation**, with every hot path profiled, every allocation scrutinized, and every pruning threshold tuned. The result is an engine that is **over 30% faster** than its C++ ancestor while playing sharp, attacking chess inspired by the legendary **Mikhail Tal**.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Search Engine

Tales implements a state-of-the-art alpha-beta search with the following techniques:

- **Principal Variation Search (PVS)** with zero-window re-search
- **Aspiration Windows** with exponential widening (starting at ±8cp)
- **Null Move Pruning (NMP)** with adaptive Stockfish-style reduction and verification search at high depths
- **Static Null Move Pruning** (Reverse Futility) at depths ≤ 3
- **Razoring** (Toga II–style) at depths ≤ 4 — drops into quiescence when far below beta
- **Futility Pruning** for quiet moves at depths ≤ 6
- **Late Move Reductions (LMR)** with logarithmic tables, PV-aware, history-adjusted
- **Singular Extensions** for clearly dominant TT moves (Senpai-style)
- **Check Extensions**, **Pawn-to-7th Extensions**
- **Internal Iterative Deepening (IID)** when no hash move is available
- **Mate Distance Pruning** to cut off proven mates

### ♟️ Quiescence Search

- **3-layer architecture**: checks → evasions → captures-only
- Full TT probing in all QS layers
- SEE-based capture filtering

### 📊 Move Ordering

- TT move → Captures (MVV-LVA) → Killers (2 per ply) → Countermove/Refutation → History heuristic
- History bonus on beta cutoffs, malus on previously failed quiet moves
- Null-move refutation square tracking

### ⚡ Multi-Threaded Search (Lazy SMP)

- Shared lockless transposition table across all threads
- Odd-numbered threads search at `depth + 1` for natural diversification
- Lagging thread skip: threads that fall behind rejoin at useful depths
- Atomic coordination via `AtomicBool` (abort), `AtomicI32` (depth reached), `AtomicU64` (node count)
- Only the main thread (thread 0) prints UCI info lines

### 📖 Opening Book

Tales includes a **dual book system** — an always-available internal book compiled into the binary, plus optional support for user-supplied external Polyglot books:

#### Internal Book (default)

- **Polyglot-format Tal book** (`ph-tal2.bin`, ~2 MB) compiled directly into the binary via `include_bytes!`
- Canonical 781-entry Polyglot Zobrist table for position hashing
- **Weighted random selection** with configurable filter threshold (default 20%)
- Binary search for O(log n) probing, executes *before* the search thread is spawned
- No external book files required — works out of the box

#### External Book (v1.0a+)

- Users can specify any **Polyglot `.bin` book** via the `MainBookFile` UCI option
- Enable with `UseBook true` — the engine loads the file from disk into memory
- When a valid external book is loaded, it is used **instead of** the internal book
- If the file is not found or invalid, the engine prints an error and **falls back** to the internal book
- The external book uses the same weighted random selection and Zobrist hashing as the internal book
- Hot-swappable: changing `MainBookFile` while `UseBook` is active immediately reloads the new file

#### Book Move Selection (`BookFilter`)

Both the internal and external books use **weighted random selection** controlled by the `BookFilter` UCI option (0–100, default 20). This determines how selective the engine is when choosing from multiple book moves for the same position:

- **`BookFilter 0`** — Consider *all* book moves, regardless of weight. Maximum opening variety.
- **`BookFilter 20`** (default) — Filter out moves below 20% of the best move's weight. Balanced play.
- **`BookFilter 100`** — Only consider the highest-weighted move(s). Deterministic, strongest-line play.

Among the surviving candidates, the engine picks a move via weighted random selection — higher-weighted moves are still more likely to be chosen, but lower-weighted alternatives add variety.

### 🏰 Evaluation Engine

The evaluation is a comprehensive hand-crafted evaluation with ~200 parameters, all tuned for aggressive, Tal-like play:

- **Material evaluation** with bishop pair, knight pair, rook pair adjustments
- **Material imbalance** table (Crafty-style 9×9 matrix)
- **Piece-Square Tables (PSTs)** — separate MG/EG tables for all piece types, with outpost and pawn formation tables
- **Piece mobility** — per-piece-type mobility tables (knight 0–8, bishop 0–13, rook 0–14, queen 0–27)
- **King safety** — non-linear danger table (quadratic curve, 512 entries) driven by accumulated attack scores
- **King tropism** — bonus for piece proximity to the enemy king
- **Pawn structure** — doubled, isolated, backward pawn penalties; pawn islands; pawn binds
- **Pawn chains** — full triad evaluator (e.g., c6-d5-e4 complexes) with storm pattern detection
- **Pawn shield & storm** — rank-based shield penalties and storm bonuses around the castled king
- **Passed pawns** — rank-based MG/EG bonuses with stop-square control multipliers
- **Candidate passers** — bonuses for pawns that could become passers
- **Pattern recognition** — knight traps, bishop traps, blocked bishops, fianchetto bonuses, central patterns, king patterns
- **Threats** — bonus for pieces attacking undefended enemy pieces
- **Endgame scaling** — KPK, KBPK, KNPK, KRPKR, KQKRP draw detection and scaling
- **KBN vs K** checkmate helper
- **Eval caching** — 65536-entry evaluation hash table
- **Pawn hash table** — separate pawn structure cache
- **Asymmetric attack weights** — own attack scaled at 450%, opponent at 100% (Tal-like aggression)
- **Piece-keeping bonuses** — reluctance to trade queens and knights
- **Tempo bonus** — 14cp MG / 7cp EG for the side to move
- **Phase interpolation** — smooth MG↔EG blending based on material phase (0–24)

### 🔧 UCI Interface

- 16 fully implemented UCI options
- **UCI_Elo** strength limiting with NPS throttling and eval blur
- **MultiPV** support (up to 64 lines)
- **Pondering** support
- Built-in `bench` command for regression testing
- `d` / `print` command for board display

### 🎯 Strength Limiting

- **UCI_LimitStrength** + **UCI_Elo** (800–2800)
- Automatic NPS throttling and evaluation noise injection
- Adjustable selectivity, contempt, and time management via UCI options

## 🚀 Performance & Optimizations

Every module was **profiled with flamegraph analysis** and optimized for maximum throughput. We identified critical hot paths in the search and evaluation code and applied targeted optimizations:

| Optimization | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **`OnceLock` → `AtomicPtr`** | Eliminated atomic-load + unwrap overhead from the three hottest lookup tables (leaper attacks, magic bitboards, between-rays) — single largest win at ~14% |
| **Compile-time castle mask** | `castle_mask()` table is now a `const` array instead of runtime `OnceLock`, removing overhead from every `do_move()` call |
| **`get_unchecked` indexing** | Bounds-check elimination across TT probes, eval hash, repetition list, and move ordering |
| **TT pointer arithmetic** | Transposition table 4-bucket probe uses raw pointer iteration instead of per-bucket index computation |
| **`std::mem::zeroed()` arrays** | Eliminates redundant initialization of `MoveList` (~2KB), PV arrays, and quiet move arrays in the search loop |
| **4-bucket TT** | Age-based replacement with 64-bit full keys for correctness |
| **Stack-allocated arrays** | All move lists and PV arrays are fixed-size on the stack — zero heap allocation in the search |
| **Incremental PST scoring** | Position scores updated incrementally during `do_move` / `undo_move` |
| **LMR table in L1 cache** | Move dimension clamped to 64 entries to fit the full table in 32KB L1 |
| **Eval hash + Pawn hash** | Two-level caching avoids redundant evaluation of seen positions and pawn structures |
| **Fat LTO** | Full link-time optimization across all crates for maximum inlining |
| **Single codegen unit** | Enables whole-program optimization passes |
| **`panic = "abort"`** | Eliminates unwinding overhead in release builds |
| **`-C target-cpu=native`** | Automatic use of POPCNT, BMI2, AVX2 hardware instructions |

### Build Profile

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
```

### Results

- **~1.77 million nodes per second** (single-threaded) on standard hardware
- **18% NPS improvement** in v1.1.0-alpha via profiler-guided hot-path optimization (samply + MAP symbol resolution)
- **30%+ throughput increase** over the C++ OpenTal engine
- **Zero** crashes, zero illegal moves across 10,000+ tested plies

---

## 🏆 Tournament Results

**Tournament results need to be updated following the 1.0b release.**

### Stability Record

- ✅ Zero crashes or engine failures
- ✅ Zero illegal moves
- ✅ Zero `bestmove NONE` forfeits
- ✅ Stable across multi-threaded configurations

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tales.git
cd tales
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/tales.exe` (Windows) or `target/release/tales` (Linux).

> **Note**: No external files are needed. The opening book is embedded in the binary. To use a custom opening book, see the UCI options `UseBook` and `MainBookFile` below.

### Running with a GUI

Tales works with any UCI-compatible chess GUI:

- [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
- [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/)
- [Lucas Chess](https://lucaschess.pythonanywhere.com/)
- [Banksia GUI](https://banksiagui.com/)

Simply add the `tales` binary as a new engine in your GUI of choice.

### Running the Built-in Benchmark

```bash
./tales --bench
```

This runs a fixed set of 5 positions at increasing depths and reports total nodes, NPS, and time.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.2

### Rust 2024 Edition

- Migrated the entire codebase to **Rust edition 2024** (requires rustc 1.94.1+)
- Modernized patterns throughout: replaced legacy `unsafe` blocks and C-style idioms with idiomatic Rust 2024 patterns
- Introduced `SearchCtx` and `SearchFrame` structs for cleaner search API ergonomics, replacing the previous `too_many_arguments` pattern

### Full Ponder Support

- Implemented complete UCI **ponder** functionality
- The engine searches in the background on the expected opponent reply
- On `ponderhit`, the search transitions seamlessly to normal time-controlled mode
- Correctly reports `bestmove` + `ponder` move pairs

### Performance Optimizations (+18% NPS)

Profiled with **samply** (ETW sampling at 8kHz) with MAP file symbol resolution and rustfilt demangling. Key optimizations based on resolved profile data (14,811 samples):

- **`OnceLock` → `AtomicPtr`** for leaper attacks, magic bitboards, and between-ray tables — the single largest win (~14% alone). `Ordering::Relaxed` compiles to a plain `mov` instruction on x86-64, vs the previous `Acquire` atomic load + `Option::unwrap()` branch
- **Compile-time `castle_mask`** — converted from runtime `OnceLock` to a `const` array, eliminating overhead from every `do_move()` call
- **Unchecked hot-path access** — `get_unchecked` for eval hash, repetition list, and attack table lookups where indices are provably in-bounds
- **TT pointer arithmetic** — transposition table probe uses raw pointer iteration instead of per-bucket index computation
- **Stack allocation reduction** — `std::mem::zeroed()` for `MoveList` (~2KB), PV arrays, and quiet move arrays, eliminating redundant initialization at millions of nodes/sec

### Codebase Quality

- Comprehensive architectural audit — removed orphaned scope blocks, deduplicated evaluation logic, standardized naming conventions
- Full CI test suite covering perft, search correctness, and evaluation parity

## 📋 What's New in 1.0a

### External Opening Book Support

Tales now supports **user-supplied Polyglot opening books**. This allows you to replace the built-in Tal-style book with any `.bin` Polyglot book file — from a broader GM repertoire to a specialized opening suite.

**How to use:**

1. Set the path to your book file:

   ```
   setoption name MainBookFile value /path/to/my-book.bin
   ```

2. Enable external book usage:

   ```
   setoption name UseBook value true
   ```

3. The engine will confirm loading:

   ```
   info string loaded external book '/path/to/my-book.bin' (128903 entries)
   ```

**Error handling:** If the file cannot be found or is corrupt, the engine prints an error and automatically falls back to the internal embedded book:

```
info string error loading external book: cannot read 'missing.bin': ... — using internal book
```

**Behavior summary:**

| `UseBook` | External file found | Book used |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:---------:|
| `false`   | —                   | Internal  |
| `true`    | ✅ Yes              | External  |
| `true`    | ❌ No / invalid     | Internal (fallback) |

### Book Move Quality Filter

The new **`BookFilter`** option (inspired by Rodent III/IV) controls how selective the engine is when choosing from book moves:

```
setoption name BookFilter value 0     # use all book moves (maximum variety)
setoption name BookFilter value 20    # default — filter weak alternatives
setoption name BookFilter value 100   # always play the best book move
```

The value is a percentage threshold: moves whose weight is below `(best_weight × BookFilter / 100)` are excluded. This applies to both the internal and external books.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments & Credits

Tales stands on the shoulders of giants. This engine would not exist without the foundational work of the open-source chess programming community.

### OpenTal & Rodent III

Tales is a modern Rust reimplementation inspired by the **OpenTal** engine, which is itself a derivative of the **Rodent III** chess engine. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the original creators:

- **Pawel Koziol** — Creator of **Rodent III**, whose innovative evaluation architecture, comprehensive pattern recognition, and the idea of a chess engine with character formed the algorithmic foundation for Tales. The evaluation philosophy — from the pawn chain triad evaluator to the non-linear king danger table — traces directly back to Pawel's visionary work.

- **Pablo Vazquez** — Creator of **Sungorus 1.4**, the original engine from which the Rodent family was derived.

Both Rodent III and OpenTal are released under the **GNU General Public License** (GPL), and Tales proudly continues in that tradition.

### The Chess Programming Community

Tales also draws inspiration from techniques pioneered by the broader community:

- **Stockfish** — Null move reduction formula, LMR table construction, mate distance pruning
- **Toga II** — Razoring implementation
- **Senpai** — Singular extension approach
- **The Chess Programming Wiki** — An invaluable resource for search and evaluation algorithms
